# 1 - Hello World!
**Skills**: Tags

Hello! HTML is all about taking content, such as titles, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks and so much more, and marking it clearly as what it is, so the computer knows how to display it properly.

## Tags
This is a tag:
```HTML
<p>Hello World</p>
```

Tags are what we use in HTML in order to tell our web browser what kind of content something is. 
For example, find the first p tags in the *index.html* file. Press "Run" at the top of the screen if you haven't already. 

You will notice that section 1.1 and 1.2 are almost identical, apart from the fact that 1.1 is using p tags, and 1.2 isn't. It is this distinction that is soooo important to grasp early on when learning HTML. If you don't put tags around your content, nothing will display how you want it to. 

## No Tags
In 1.2, notice how the line spacing in the HTML code doesn't actually appear when you look at the finished result on the right - its all just one long sentence!

We must use tags in HTML to define how we want our content to be structured. The computer doesn't care how your code looks, it only cares about the tags you use. 

## Blank Lines
We CAN add in extra blank lines by using the Line Break tag `<br>`.
Most tags need a start and an end tag, like the `<p>` tag in 1.1 has both a start: `<p>` and an end: `</p>` to show where the paragraph starts and ends.
The `<br>` tag doesn't need an end tag, as it doesn't need to surround any text - it is just telling the computer to move onto a new line.

## TRY THIS!
Try inserting a couple of <br> tags in between the two sets of `<p>` tags in *index.html*. Does it make a difference if both `<br>` tags are on the same line?
