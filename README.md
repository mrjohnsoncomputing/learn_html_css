# HTML & CSS
Welcome to this series of lessons which aim to take you from no knowledge of HTML and CSS and guide you through a series of enjoyable activities to develop your understanding. 

I'm going to be honest, the first two activities are a lot of reading for you, and not a lot of doing. 

It is important that you stick with it and read them carefully, because you will then be set tasks where you can play and explore with a lot less guidance. 

I hope you enjoy this, and if you have any feedback on any of the activities please let me know. 

## Getting Started
Click on *1 - Hello World.md* to get started. (On the left)

All activities where you have to write code will take place inside the *index.html* file, unless otherwise stated. 

## Attitude
The idea behind these tasks is for you to be self-motivated to explore, try out new things and not worry about getting things perfect the first time round. 

It is down to you to put in the effort, and I think that you will easily get out whatever you put into this. 

**Happy coding!**
