    <h3>1.1 - The Paragraph Tag</h3>
    <p>Hello, this is a paragraph tag in action!</p>
    <p>Notice how there is a line between us? That is because we defined the above line as a paragraph, and we defined this as a separate paragraph, by using the p tags </p>

    <h3>1.2 - No Paragraph Tags</h3>
    Hello, this is a paragraph tag in action!


    Notice how there is no line between us? That is because these lines have not been defined as anything, so the computer just prints this out one after the other.
