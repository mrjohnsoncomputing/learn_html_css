# 3 - Exploring Tags
**Skills**: Tags

Blimey, that last section went on a bit didn't it?
It's important that you read and understood it though, so if you didn't, do your future-self a favour and go back and read it properly - it will make doing this section much easier. 

I have spent so much time typing at you, and you've only really had the chance to put in a few `<br>` tags.

Now it is time for you to have a bit of a play!

## Task

Firstly, please delete everything between the `<body>  </body>` tags inside *index.html* 

Then I would like you to create a web page fact-file all about an animal that you like. It could be your favourite, it could be one you just find interesting, or scary, or endangered. It just has to be about an animal. 

You should aim to include pictures, stats, descriptions, links to further information and all the while trying to keep a nice looking layout. 

[Here is a list](https://www.mrjc.co.uk/home/ks3-cs/text/html-css) of some HTML tags that you can explore. (Right click on the link and "Open in New Tab")
